# ViewBox
Swift UIView layout helper

ViewBox provides an alternative to layout constraints and autoresizing.  ViewBox provides concise but readable access to view frames without the ambiguiuty, slowness and other limitations of constraints.

The primary use of ViewBox is in the layout subviews method of UIView or the related UIViewController methods.  Simply set the positions and sizes of every view that needs to be updated.
